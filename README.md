# Handwritten Digit Classification

A simple handwritten digit classification project using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
2. Install the required Python packages, including TensorFlow and Matplotlib:
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib
3.Open and run the handwritten_digit_classification.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to see the code and its execution.
4.Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the MNIST dataset, preprocess the data, create and train the neural network model, and evaluate its accuracy.
5.Optionally, you can modify the code, experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and preprocessing techniques to improve classification performance.

## Usage
This code is provided as a starting point for building a handwritten digit classification system. You can use it as a template to develop your own image classification projects or as a learning resource to understand how to work with TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning tasks.
